The globally renowned Pulitzer Prize-winner gives us an entirely new view of a nation in crisis in his newest stunning book, America: The Farewell Tour, which holds both liberals and conservatives to account--as rousingly pertinent for Canada as for the disoriented US. Beautifully written, it clarifies vividly and unforgettably the forces at play in our times.\r\n\r\nIn astonishing, tough, first-hand reportage, Chris Hedges draws on stories from inside communities across America and reveals how the hurricanes of change have allowed an array of pathologies to arise: the opioid crisis, the retreat into gambling, the corporate coup d'\u00e9tat of government, the pornification of culture, the rise of magical thinking, the emboldening of violence and hate, the plagues of suicides, and the global upheaval caused by catastrophic climate change. These are just some of the physical manifestations of a society unravelling. Such ills presage a frightening reconfiguration of our lives--particularly in the face of our neighbour's degeneration as a world power.\r\n\r\nDonald Trump rode this disenchantment to power. Hedges--who was unsurprised by Trump's victory--shows how neither the left nor the right are addressing the systemic problems. Until the corporate coup d'\u00e9tat is reversed, these diseases will grow and ravage the country. A humane cry for a decent future, this remarkable book is our wake-up call to reality.","image":"https://www.cigionline.org/sites/default/files/images/landscape/America%20The%20Farewell%20Tour%20cover%20image_2.jpg"},{"id":"14518","title":"\u201cOpen Data Endgame\u201d Twitter Chat","subtitle":"","authors":[],"speakers":[],"published_date":"","event_date":"2018-08-21T14:00:00","url_landing_page":"https://www.cigionline.org/events/open-data-endgame-twitter-chat","pdf_url":"","type":"event","subtype":[],"word_count":189,"program":[],"research_areas":[],"summary":"In today\u2019s big data landscape, the collection and use of personal information have serious consequences for privacy and democracy.

Experts on this panel will offer a diverse perspective on three issues that are at the intersection of IP, sustainable trade and technology: the potential implications of disruptive technologies on international trade; the function of IP rights as a driver of innovation in promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization by 2030; and the key elements to be included in a TRIPs 2.0 version to foster innovation. \r\nThe session\u2019s objective is to build dialogue on the implications of disruptive technologies on intellectual property norms in global trade, how IP rights and advanced technologies can together build a sustainable industrialization economy and foster innovation (SDG 9).

Yet they did not. Nor have they united to oppose\u00a0Chinese aggression in the South China Sea or Russian offensives along its Western border.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean balance of power politics is dead, argues renowned international relations scholar T.V.\u00a0Paul, but that it has taken a different form. Rather than employ familiar strategies such as active military alliances and arms buildups, leading powers have engaged in \u201csoft balancing,\u201d which seeks to restrain threatening powers through the use of international institutions, informal alignments, and economic sanctions. Paul places the evolution of balancing behavior in historical perspective from the post Napoleonic era to today\u2019s globalized world.

The film challenges the notion cyber harassment is \u201conly\u201d online, showing the repercussions on targets\u2019 lives: lost jobs, thwarted educations, damaged reputations, offline harassment and stalking, and countless hours devoted to containing attacks against a backdrop of mounting legal fees and psychological distress. While law enforcement lags far behind the crimes, the film\u2019s subjects seek justice on their own terms. Carrie's law firm takes off in the midst of the #MeToo movement; Tina speaks out about her experiences and breaks back into the finance industry; and Anita creates a new series about race, gender and inequality in America. NETIZENS bears witness as a courageous wave of individuals transform the web as we know it.\r\n\r\nAbout the Panel\r\n\r\nFollowing the film, a panel discussion will take place featuring local experts, discussing both issues raised in the film and other intersections of safety and technology, gender, consent and the law.\r\n\r\nContent Warning: The film and the panel following will include frank and explicit discussion of online harrasment, and other forms of digital abuse and threatening behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Cinema Series\r\n\r\nThe Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), is pleased to announce a new partnership with the Grand River Film Festival, and THEMUSEUM to deliver public film screening events throughout the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nFilm Partnership logos","image":"https://www.cigionline.org/sites/default/files/images/landscape/Netizens_Splash_Larger_110218.jpg"},{"id":"15157","title":"Media and Mass Atrocity Book Launch: Frontline Club","subtitle":"","authors":[],"speakers":[],"published_date":"","event_date":"2019-04-17T23:00:00","url_landing_page":"https://www.cigionline.org/events/media-and-mass-atrocity-book-launch-frontline-club","pdf_url":"","type":"event","subtype":[],"word_count":870,"program":[],"research_areas":[],"summary":"To mark the 25 years that have passed since the Rwandan genocide, we\u2019ll be discussing the role of media in times of civil conflict and mass atrocity.

Sustainable Development Goal 8 focuses on building sustainable economic growth, ensuring decent work for all, and addressing labour market inequality. However, in the context of a finite planet experiencing climate breakdown, some experts see inherent inconsistencies in this goal. A particular point of conflict is the idea that economic growth is necessary to address the imbalances that exist in access to the market.

Other technology-rich countries, such as Japan and Korea, have surprisingly few TRIPS-plus provisions on patent protection in their trade agreements. Few South-South trade agreements include TRIPS-plus provisions, but some include TRIPS-extra provisions on genetic resources and traditional knowledge.

In April 2018, the US government released a report claiming that China fails to offer sufficient protection for intellectual property (IP) rights. Among other things, the United States criticized China for its failure to \u201caddress major gaps in copyright protection.\u201d\u00a0Claiming that Chinese IP practices have destroyed \u201cthousands of American factories and millions of American jobs,\u201d US President Donald Trump \u201cannounced approximately $50 billion in additional tariffs.\u201d\u00a0China immediately reacted with retaliatory measures and the two countries entered a tit-for-tat trade war. The only way out of this escalation appears to be a bilateral trade deal in which China makes additional IP commitments and the United States abandons its unilateral trade sanctions.","image":"https://www.cigionline.org/sites/default/files/images/landscape/shutterstock_408286072.jpg"},{"id":"15279","title":"Governing Cyberspace during a Crisis in Trust","subtitle":"An essay series on the economic potential \u2014 and vulnerability \u2014 of transformative technologies and cyber security","authors":["Aaron Shull","Andre Boysen","Bill Munson","Byron Holland","Christian Leuprecht","Christopher S.

Intellectual property is being stolen from companies at an alarming rate. Foreign actors are meddling in elections.

On one hand, technology has led to convenience, efficiency and wealth creation. On the other hand, this great push to digitize society has meant building inherent vulnerability into the core of the economic model.

  paragraph1: 'Launched at the United Nations in New York City, the World Refugee Council’s report laid out 55 concrete actions to protect refugees and internally displaced persons and support the countries and local communities that host them. Council Chair Lloyd Axworthy’s calls to ambassadors and international organizations to adopt the report’s recommendations garnered high-profile media coverage, especially around a push to freeze the assets of those causing conflicts. “There is an appetite to end the growing impunity and deficit of accountability on the part of those responsible for the conflicts and other actions that are forcing people to flee their homes and countries,” he said.'
  paragraph2: 'With more than two million Venezuelans fleeing crisis in their country, CIGI partnered with Inter-American Dialogue to create a plan of action for an international response. A timely op-ed in the Washington Post, co-authored by Global Security and Politics Director Fen Osler Hampson, made a strong case for seizing the money of Venezuelan leaders to benefit the county’s citizens.'

  paragraph1: '<em>Braiding Legal Orders</em> is the culmination of the ILRP’s research over the past three years on the implementation in Canada of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). Indigenous law experts discuss the relationship between international law, Indigenous people’s own laws and Canada’s constitutional narratives. Like a braid that gains strength from many strands woven together, authors of the book encourage readers to imagine a process of braiding together strands of constitutional, international and Indigenous people’s own laws. On June 4, 2019, the Honourable Mary Jane McCallum, Senator, referenced CIGI’s work on UNDRIP to the Canadian Senate on the third reading of Bill C-69 as she encouraged her fellow colleagues to support the Bill. <em>Braiding Legal Orders</em> made the \#1 spot on Amazon’s bestseller list in the categories of international law and civil law.'

    quote: 'Only if the UN Declaration is implemented in a historically informed manner that allows Canada to reconsider the history for Indigenous self-determination will Canada be able to move towards a real nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous peoples.'

chairsMessage:
  paragraph1: 'Innovations in our digital world have significant impacts on how we communicate, conduct business and function as a society. In less than a generation, technological advances to artificial intelligence (AI) systems, driven by a wealth of big data, have led to scientific and industrial progress but also raised fears of privacy violations and a culture of mass surveillance.'
  paragraph2: 'These changes have come in such rapid succession — cryptocurrencies are quickly taking their place among financial services and AI systems based on big data have been blamed for misinformation campaigns — that they have outpaced current policies as well as global rules and regulations.'
  paragraph3: 'CIGI’s response to these questions has been timely and impactful. Through the Data Governance in the Digital Age series of essays and other work, numerous experts have proposed ways to handle data and intellectual property (IP) challenges internationally. They have also built a strong case for Canada to develop its own data strategy. Many of the ideas in the series have led to policy discussions in Ottawa and elsewhere and been discussed in editorial pages in national newspapers. The essays were collected into a printed special report, which is currently in its second printing.'
  paragraph4: 'CIGI’s leadership on data governance is crucial because big data and its management is becoming one of the important public policy issues of our time. Data’s relationship to public safety, cyber security and trade agreements, as well as privacy rights and ethical questions around AI, have a profound impact on local, national and international institutions.'
  paragraph5: 'Thanks to our partnerships with many private and public institutions, including the Governments of Canada and Ontario, and the City of Waterloo, CIGI is well positioned to insert new ideas into policy discourse and advance our collective responses to the complex challenges posed by today’s knowledge-based and data-driven global economy.'

  paragraph2: 'With this paradox in mind, CIGI responded by bringing together policy makers, industry leaders and academics to create an essay series titled Governing Cyberspace during a Crisis in Trust. The digital essays and accompanying multimedia generated strong social engagement and notable traffic — more than 90,000 views combined in the first month of publication. The series was also printed as a magazine that was widely distributed to government officials and senior public servants.'

Since then, there have been a striking number of cases of commercially and politically driven misinformation, foreign interference in elections, data breaches, cyber attacks, the proliferation of harmful speech, data exploitation and surveillance abuses.'
  paragraph2: 'At this inflection point — in which democracies are strained by technologies — there is a pressing need for policy makers, civil society and the private sector alike to put forth a coordinated effort to govern the digital public sphere. In response to this gap in regulation, CIGI has led discussion in Canada and internationally on frameworks for social media regulation and the impacts of misinformation, including testimony before the Grand Committee on Big Data, Privacy and Democracy.'

Media and Mass Atrocity provides a critical, and often grim, review of the Rwanda genocide. It also reviews other cases of mass violence and the role of terror organizations such as ISIS, which uses media, particularly social media, to their own advantage.'
  paragraph2: 'Edited by veteran foreign affairs journalist and CIGI Senior Fellow Allan Thompson, with contributions from frontline war correspondents and academic researchers, with a chapter and foreword by General Roméo Dallaire, the book received a great deal of media interest. Thompson was interviewed on CTV News, Global News and The Agenda, and was interviewed on CBC Radio Syndication from Halifax to Victoria.'

As a result, the public dialogue is being shaped by large, well-financed interests trying to maximize data sharing. But, large-scale privately-driven data sharing is not the only way — or even the most important way — to use data trusts.'
  paragraph2: 'In response to the data trust’s move away from obscurity, CIGI has contributed to the discussion on what, exactly, a data trust is, and how it can be used as a tool for effective data governance. A recent federal proposal to modernize PIPEDA cited Bianca Wylie and Sean McDonald’s multimedia approach to defining the role of a data trust in modern governance. Amid global calls for improved data governance frameworks, rethinking the data trust is just one step toward improvement data use and management.'

  paragraph1: 'Today we are witnessing dramatic changes brought on by big data, AI and automation in the workplace. More than just technological advances, these changes are fundamentally impacting our economies, democratic systems and even the fabric of our societies.'
  paragraph2: 'As a think tank focused on innovation, we have quickly brought our attention to these changes. We are assessing not only the opportunities they present but also the very real risks to citizens’ rights, international relations and the institutions we depend on, many of which are already under attack from nationalist movements.'
  paragraph3: 'Questions about online privacy and the ability for governments and other actors to meddle in democratic processes and hack institutions became increasingly relevant this year with revelations of data misuse by Cambridge Analytica and government-led misinformation campaigns. Public-private partnerships for bridging the gaps between self-regulation and other types of governance will be vital. CIGI’s work with Stanford’s Global Digital Policy Incubator, Heritage Canada and others will provide insights to protect citizens’ rights.'
  paragraph4: 'The increasingly digitalized economy also poses new challenges to the future of how we work. Through recent research and our collaboration with the Group of Seven (G7) and Group of Twenty (G20) processes, we have proposed approaches to preparing for the impacts of increased automation and AI on workforces.'
  paragraph5: 'CIGI continues to conduct in-depth research and explore policy options in many areas, all of which are affected in one way or another by the rapid changes we are seeing in the digital world driven by innovation and technological change: trade analysis on renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); women’s economic empowerment; research-based solutions to global refugee system challenges; and new work focused on trade, finance and other issues with China and India.'
  paragraph6: 'I am proud that CIGI is a leader on tackling the fundamental issues of our times. We have truly become a digital think tank for a digital era.'

  paragraph2: 'Prepared by TCEI Commissioner and former Canadian justice minister Allan Rock, Election Risk Monitor: Canada praised Canada for the “positive and commendable steps” it has taken to safeguard its democratic process ahead of the 2019 federal election and highlighted its “global leadership role” in this area.'
  paragraph3: 'However, the report warned that important gaps remain — particularly the need for regulations that would require social media companies to take concrete action to help stop the spread of disinformation, and that would impose major sanctions should they fail to comply.'
  paragraph4: 'The report received media coverage across Canada from The Globe and Mail, National Post and CBC.ca, among others, and helped advance an important discussion on how Canada and other democracies can protect against foreign interference.'

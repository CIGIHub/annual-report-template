  paragraph1: 'Innovations in our digital world have significant impacts on how we communicate, conduct business and function as a society. In less than a generation, technological advances to artificial intelligence (AI) systems, driven by a wealth of big data, have led to scientific and industrial progress but also raised fears of privacy violations and a culture of mass surveillance.'
  paragraph2: 'These changes have come in such rapid succession — cryptocurrencies are quickly taking their place among financial services and AI systems based on big data have been blamed for misinformation campaigns — that they have outpaced current policies as well as global rules and regulations.'
  paragraph3: 'CIGI’s response to these questions has been timely and impactful. Through the Data Governance in the Digital Age series of essays and other work, numerous experts have proposed ways to handle data and intellectual property (IP) challenges internationally. They have also built a strong case for Canada to develop its own data strategy. Many of the ideas in the series have led to policy discussions in Ottawa and elsewhere and been discussed in editorial pages in national newspapers. The essays were collected into a printed special report, which is currently in its second printing.'
  paragraph4: 'CIGI’s leadership on data governance is crucial because big data and its management is becoming one of the important public policy issues of our time. Data’s relationship to public safety, cyber security and trade agreements, as well as privacy rights and ethical questions around AI, have a profound impact on local, national and international institutions.'
  paragraph5: 'Thanks to our partnerships with many private and public institutions, including the Governments of Canada and Ontario, and the City of Waterloo, CIGI is well positioned to insert new ideas into policy discourse and advance our collective responses to the complex challenges posed by today’s knowledge-based and data-driven global economy.'

  paragraph1: 'From luxury brands like Gucci and Louis Vuitton to mainstream retailers like Urban Outfitters, many brands have developed a noticeable appetite for all things traditional, ethnic and folklore. When traditional cultural expressions (TCEs)—a term developed by the World Intellectual Property Organization that describes patterns, motifs and other design features created by traditional or Indigenous cultures—are appropriated it can cause profound cultural, social and economic harm for those who the TCE belongs to.'
  paragraph2: 'CIGI fellow Brigitte Vézina’s paper, <em>Curbing Cultural Appropriation in the Fashion Industry</em> calls on reform to intellectual property laws, as well as practical solutions for designers and consumers to put an end of cultural appropriation. The paper garnered interest from engaged citizens to media interviews with the <em>Canadian Press</em> and <em>The Telegraph</em>.'
  quote:
    quote: 'There is a gray zone between harmful misuse and permissible inspiration that creates an ideal breeding ground for cultural appropriation. Putting an end to cultural appropriation would require reform to IP laws, principles and systems to better control cultural representation.'

  paragraph2: 'Conducted by Ipsos on behalf of CIGI, in partnership with the Internet Society and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the survey provides invaluable insight into the views of internet users on a range of topics.'
  paragraph3: 'The 2019 survey results made headlines around world — especially in Canada, with coverage in The Globe and Mail, National Post, La Presse, CBC News Network, CTV National News and more.'
  paragraph4: 'From findings on how many people have fallen for fake news (84% said they had at least once) to what’s causing people to distrust the internet (75% said social media companies, just behind cyber criminals at 81%), the survey provided governments, policy makers, industry leaders and others with a host of critical data to inform decisions and advance debate in the internet governance and cyber security space.'

Amid global calls for improved data governance frameworks, rethinking the data trust is just one step toward improved data use and management.'

  paragraph1: 'Today we are witnessing dramatic changes brought on by big data, AI and automation in the workplace. More than just technological advances, these changes are fundamentally impacting our economies, democratic systems and even the fabric of our societies.'
  paragraph2: 'As a think tank focused on innovation, we have quickly brought our attention to these changes. We are assessing not only the opportunities they present but also the very real risks to citizens’ rights, international relations and the institutions we depend on, many of which are already under attack from nationalist movements.'
  paragraph3: 'Questions about online privacy and the ability for governments and other actors to meddle in democratic processes and hack institutions became increasingly relevant this year with revelations of data misuse by Cambridge Analytica and government-led misinformation campaigns. Public-private partnerships for bridging the gaps between self-regulation and other types of governance will be vital. CIGI’s work with Stanford’s Global Digital Policy Incubator, Heritage Canada and others will provide insights to protect citizens’ rights.'
  paragraph4: 'The increasingly digitalized economy also poses new challenges to the future of how we work. Through recent research and our collaboration with the Group of Seven (G7) and Group of Twenty (G20) processes, we have proposed approaches to preparing for the impacts of increased automation and AI on workforces.'
  paragraph5: 'CIGI continues to conduct in-depth research and explore policy options in many areas, all of which are affected in one way or another by the rapid changes we are seeing in the digital world driven by innovation and technological change: trade analysis on renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); women’s economic empowerment; research-based solutions to global refugee system challenges; and new work focused on trade, finance and other issues with China and India.'
  paragraph6: 'I am proud that CIGI is a leader on tackling the fundamental issues of our times. We have truly become a digital think tank for a digital era.'
